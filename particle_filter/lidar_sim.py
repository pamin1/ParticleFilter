        '''
        Simulate the lidar sensor readings given the current pose of the robot.  Please see the lab handout for more details and helpful figures.

        Parameters:
        pose (SE2): The current pose of the robot, represented as an SE2 object, 
        which includes the x and y coordinates and the heading (orientation) of 
        the robot.

        Returns:
        np.ndarray: An array of simulated lidar measurements, where each element 
        represents the distance to the nearest wall for a specific lidar ray.

        Steps:
        1. Iterate through each lidar ray:
           - For each ray, calculate the angle based on the robot's heading and 
           the resolution of the lidar.
           - Determine the endpoint of the lidar ray based on the maximum range 
           and the calculated angle.

        2. Check for intersections with walls:
           - For each wall, check if the lidar ray intersects with the wall 
           using the line_rectangle_intersect function.
           - If an intersection is detected, calculate the intersection points 
           between the lidar ray and the edges of the wall.
           - Calculate the distances from the robot to these intersection points.

        4. Find the minimum distance:
           - Among all intersection points, find the minimum distance and update 
           the measurements array for the corresponding ray.

        5. Return the measurements:
           - Return the array of simulated lidar measurements.
